# DNA-Reverse-Compliment

In this project, I import my previous module (DNA_Nucleotide_Counter) and add to it, hoping to generate a reverse complement sequence to the user's unique DNA sequence input.

Here I explore importation methods, dictionary defining for complement nucleotides, as well as implementing a function that loops through the user's unique sequence to swap the characters as well as reverse it.
